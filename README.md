# PMan
In order to build my pman project simply use the Makefile by typing in the command "make".
Now, to run pman use the "./pman" command. This will prompt your input with PMan: > .
Now, you're ready to use any of the commands outlined in the assignment description. 

Additional note: Unfortunately I was not able to get the Utime and Stime to be read properly. They are always output as 0.
